# Individual_Data_Science_Project

# Introduction

The purpose of this project is primarily to practice my skills working with data with the tools python has to offer (such as Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib). The secondary objective is to understand just how safe traveling by air is. I've always heard that flying is very safe, but I was curious just how safe it is. This would include the chance of death from a flight, comparing airlines by total number of fatalities, comparing fatalities vs year, and other metrics.
